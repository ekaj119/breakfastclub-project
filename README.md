# Dad A Base
Dad A Base is a website that allows you to find the perfect dad joke to start the day. This was a project made with HTML, CSS, Bluma, and JavaScript using two API's and making them co-exist together beautifully... This was also a project for ASU Coding Bootcamp.

## Our Mission
We set out to create an applictation that can be the father you always wanted. Something that will start your day off with some humor and encouraging connections with others as you share our jokes.

## Application Requiremnts:
* Must use at least two server-side APIs
* Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
* Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
* Use at least one new third-party API
* Must have a polished UI
* Must meet good quality coding standards
* Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts (look into modals)
* Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

## The Two API's
* [ ]( ) - 
* [ ]( ) -

**Ranee** - 

**Jake** -

### Challenges:

### Successes:
Worked as a team and had fun. At least I think we did.

## Overall
I beleive we made a really good app for a two week project. The functionality is there and you can find what you are looking for. There is also a lot of room for future development.
